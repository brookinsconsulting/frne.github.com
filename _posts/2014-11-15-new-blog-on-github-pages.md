Maby you have noticed that my blog was offline many times in the past. This is now over. I moved to GitHub Pages 
so this blog is now powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and 
[Pygments Syntax Highlighter](http://pygments.org/).

I've also tried to simplify the whole design and structure thing to not overload the page with unnecessary stuff. Maybe 
there will be some more design improvements, but not really much. Instead of keeping a self-hosted Wordpress instance 
up-to-date and secure, I'll focus on content. Having a blog and around 60% of the time invested is maintenance doesn't 
make fun ;)

If you are interested in how this blog works, switch over to 
[frne/frne.github.com](https://github.com/frne/frne.github.com). It's completely open source and you find all the 
posts in markdown format. Pull-Requests very welcome...

Have fun.
